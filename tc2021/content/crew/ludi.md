ludi is a game of chance, a drunken walk, playing at the margins, somehow finding new ways to bring disparate elements together in interesting ways. Sound and instrument design often occur at the edge of a void, following component vectors through higher-dimensional manifolds. Process and product become indiscernible, threading a line of flight through a labyrinth of creativity, hiding from the monster of perfectionism. Complex fractured beats, brooding basslines, intricate arpeggios, and deeply layered pads are held together by an abstract sonic machine, dancing at the edge of light and dark, experimenting with the tension between order and chaos.
