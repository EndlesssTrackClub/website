Firephly is from California where the redwoods meet the sea. Her music builds moods exploring the light and dark, creating atmospheric soundscapes, using arpeggiated sonic elements, melodic themes with emotive keys, sweeping pads, and strong synth lines. She brings rich, vibrant vocals to create a sense of connection and warmth.
