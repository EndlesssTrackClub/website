I'm Von from the UK (also known as Vonbongen and Audubon Swamp Garden).

I sing stuff and I like creating strange noises, glitching things up, playing around with filters and delay and randomness. This is allegedly 'sound design'.

I like to invent spurious genres and then try to convince people that they actually exist. Previous attempts include commutercore, voidcore, operatic nightmare pop and horsewave.

My major influences include Pan Daijing, Duran Duran Duran, Lorn, the Black Dog, Recoil, and (mainly) the other musicians I work with in Track Club.
