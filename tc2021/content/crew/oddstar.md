I am oddSTAR -- a curious creature hurtling through space on a massive rock while desperately attempting to channel the mystical energies of the universe through experimental synthesis of organized waves and frequencies.

By deliberately applying complex aural incantations, I weave enchantments from vital elements including stirring vocals, otherworldly guitars, arpeggiated electronic pulses, ethereal pads, soaring leads, deep basslines, pulsating beats, and flowing layers of intriguing atmospheric noises and subtle textures. When properly attuned via precise melodic, harmonic and rhythmic interplay, I conjure charged temporal singularities which attract visceral emotional reactions such as joy, wonder, melancholic contemplation, arousal and irresistible rhythmic response.
