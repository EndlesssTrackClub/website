Foi Dee, real name Ferd, is based in the North of England in the heart of The North York Moors.
He is a Graphic/web artist, photo/videographer and musician.

Stealing his old mans jazz / funk and psychedelic rock records, so he could DJ at parties, he then discovered hip hop, acid, techno and the myriad of other genres and sub-genres of electronic music that came afterwards.

He has been making music for about 3 years, he tries to make music that is influenced by all of the above but with some  essence of himself infused into the sounds, textures, melodies and rhythms. 

He makes noise, it is a journey with no destination…
