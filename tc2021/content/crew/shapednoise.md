Hi all,

My name is Kirke Godfrey, going by the name of *ShapedNoise*

Im a washed-up old hack with a drinking problem and poor social skills.

Somehow got away with faking my way through a full career in music so I’m now into it strictly for fun. Currently doing some musical hardware and software design work and beta testing for several audio companies.

As to my part in the track club crew… 

I'm here to:

Provide musical parts of mind-boggling innovation, stunning clarity of vision and implementation, while also setting an awe-inspiring inspirational tone for the rest of the crew.
