I'm a musican, designer and artist from Hackney, London. I worked on earlier versions of the Endlesss app, and love exploring ways of making electronics more expressive. Iâ€™ve been playing in bands and making music for many years. My claim to fame is that John Peel, Aphex Twin, and John Kennedy have all played my stuff! I love making music with others, so Endlesss has amazing to be involved in for the past few years.
