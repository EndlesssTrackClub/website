(*pron. /də Vɛl-dən/*) Like standing above a giant perfectly circular chasm and nothing is moving. Like being pelted with a hail of arps and beats. Slaps. Weaving synths, vocal and bokeh beats into dark and groovy textures, into lush and subtle sounds, into raw, haunting and ethereal tracks. Like traveling fast above an epic primordial landscape (possibly backwards).
