\_the boundless\_ is a Chicago-based electronic music project by [Nick_Jones](https://nickjonesnexus.com/). The project spans a wide sonic spectrum, from hard-hitting Industrial/EBM to modern classical, downtempo, and filmscore music. The debut album, *The Dust Trial* (2017), and accompanying record release show in November 2017, saw the inception of Thinkbreak Records. Performances are high-energy with larger-than-life theatrics, serving as a perfect invitation to get the dancefloor moving quickly.

As Nick_Jones, he has scored *They Grow Up So Fast* (Original Motion Picture Score) and a dance-choreography piece, titled *Volve* (Dance Performance Soundtrack). Additionally, Nick_Jones is heavily focused on cutting-edge technology for audio/visual performance and an active member for Endlesss.fm, Mi.Mu Gloves beta-tester, and more.
