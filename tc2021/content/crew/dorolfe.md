Hello, Iâ€™m David (he/him) and I make music with Endlesss and my Internet friends. My primary musical influences are Orbital, Information Society, and the Florida rave scene in the mid- and late-90s (that means lots of electro, breaks, and drum and bass).

I started making electronic music 30ish years ago in BASIC on a C64, but I've finished more songs since COVID than in the prior 20 years. Thanks, Track Club!
