Started drumming in a samba drumming group from 8 years old, around 12 years old started tinkering with some crappy DAW during IT lessons at school. Went on to get a degree in Music Tech (but still don't know how to use a compressor). Always trying to find the balance between chaos and order, between experimental and danceable, fun and fresh. These usually balance out naturally through my lopsided knowledge of music, I can produce complex rhythms but my melodic and harmonic knowledge is limited, which makes these aspects more predictable. 

I live in Tokyo and I'm hoping to force my sounds on people in a live setting as soon as it's responsible to do so. In the meantime find me on Endlesss and occasionally releasing tunes here with Track Club!
