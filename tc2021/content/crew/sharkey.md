William Sharkey is from Valley Forge in Pennsylvania.

Trying to find a balance between intentional music and repetitive feedback-loop driven sound exploration.

I am a human dad, a computer programmer, and I like to think about things, getting lost chasing things. Music could be where impulses, grand gestures, costumed play can lash out and try to capture something fleeting. What am I escaping from, what am I accomplishing? Constant nagging feelings get folded into the sounds. Usually mushy. Hello world sounds.
